# Stock-Price-Predictor-using-RNN

This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques. The primary focus is to develop models that can accurately forecast stock prices based on historical data.

## Project Structure

- **Stock_Price_Predictor.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the stock price prediction models.
- **data/**: Directory containing the historical stock price data.
- **models/**: Directory to save trained models.
- **scripts/**: Directory containing scripts used for data processing and model training.

## Required Python packages:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
  - tensorflow (or another deep learning library, if applicable)

Install the required packages using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Data

The historical stock price data should be placed in the `data/` directory. Ensure the data is in a CSV format with appropriate columns, such as `Date`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, and `Volume`.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load the historical stock price data, handle missing values, and perform necessary feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the stock price trends and perform statistical analysis to understand the data distribution.
3. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models to predict stock prices. Common models include:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forest
   - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
5. **Prediction**: Use the trained models to make predictions on new, unseen data.

## Usage

To run the analysis, open the Jupyter Notebook `Stock_Price_Predictor.ipynb` and execute the cells sequentially. Ensure that the datasets are placed in the `data/` directory and the necessary Python packages are installed.
